At Hazelcast we take reliability very seriously. With the new CP Subsystem module, Hazelcast has become the first and only IMDG that offers a linearizable distributed implementation of the Java concurrency primitives backed by the Raft consensus algorithm. In addition to well-grounded designs and proven algorithms, reliability also requires a substantial amount of testing. We have been working hard to ensure the validity of our consistency claims.</description>

“Distributed locks aren’t real”, some like to remind us. “Anyone who’s trying to sell you a distributed lock is selling you sawdust and lies.” This may sound rather bleak, but it doesn’t say that locking itself is impossible in a distributed system: it’s just that all of the system’s components must participate in the protocol. This blog post is the story of how we implemented a distributed locking protocol that gives your components a straightforward way of joining in.</description>

We put Java locks on steroids! Hazelcast is now the first and only In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) to offer a linearizable and distributed implementation of the Java concurrency primitives backed by the Raft consensus algorithm. Sounds interesting? Just keep calm and carry on reading…
Hazelcast IMDG has been offering a set of concurrency APIs for a long time.</description>
