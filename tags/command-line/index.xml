      <description>Z is a command line tool that helps you to cd to directories you use with just a few key stores. It manages this by tracking the directories you visit, and weighting them by how frequently and how recently they have been visited. I have been using it happily for a long time, and now I think that I can recommend it to other people. It uses a term frecent for ranking directories.</description>
