      <description>Hello again, after more than 4 months :) So many things have changed in my life since my last blog post. I will try to talk about them from time to time, which I am not very sure about that actually :)
I have been playing with Redis and its Java client Jedis lately. It looks very promising. I&amp;rsquo;m making experimental things on it and I really liked it. I will probably use it one of my personal projects for some use cases.</description>
