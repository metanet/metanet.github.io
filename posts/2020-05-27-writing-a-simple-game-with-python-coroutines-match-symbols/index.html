<p>I have been writing Python code occasionally here and there, but never learnt Python properly. Thanks to the ongoing coronavirus crisis, we have been under lockdown in Ankara for more than 2 months and I have plenty of time to try new things. So I decided to  build a small fun project with  Python. It took me only a few days to grasp its fundamentals and start to understand how to get things done in Python. Actually, I have been learning C++ on my own for the last couple of months and when I switched to Python, it felt like I was in heaven :) It is no wonder  that Python is one of the most popular programming languages <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2019/" target="_blank">[1]</a>, <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019" target="_blank">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>I developed this game in a weekend. Actually it is an <a href="https://github.com/metanet/cardgame-server-scala" target="_blank">old habit</a> for me to build this game when I start to dig a new programming language. You can check out the game on <a href="https://github.com/metanet/match-symbols-game" blank="_target">Github</a>. Its source code is available with the MIT license and contributions are welcome!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-play">How to play</h2>

<p>The game is played by 2 people in turns. There is a deck of symbols and initially all symbols are closed. Each player opens 2 cells on her turn. If both cells have the same symbol, the player&rsquo;s score is incremented and the player opens 2 other cells. Otherwise, it becomes the other player&rsquo;s turn. The game is completed when either one of the players manages to match more than half of the symbols, or both match the same number of symbols, which is a tie.</p>

<p>The game is played via a simple and text-based TCP server. The game server supports an arbitrary number of players. Since the game is for 2 players, the game server pairs connecting players in the FIFO order. When a player joins the server, she will wait in the lobby until another player chimes in. When a player disconnects during the game, the other player returns back to the lobby. Games and communication with connected clients are handled with coroutines.</p>

<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>

<p>You can see a quick demo below. In this demo, I start a game server with the default settings, then connect 2 TELNET clients. When the first client connects, it waits for another client to join. When the second client chimes in, the game starts. Each client opens 2 cells on its turn. After some time, one of the clients just disconnect and the other client goes back to the lobby.</p>

<h2 id="try-it-yourself">Try it yourself</h2>

<p>You can start the game server as below. It binds to <code>localhost:10670</code> by default. Make sure you have Python 3.7+.</p>

<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/metanet/22e4b8945bc83702996c9af2c505f728.js"></script>


<p>Once the server is up and running,  you can connect to it with  <code>telnet localhost 10670</code>. If you want to disconnect your TELNET client,  press <code>CTRL+]</code>, then type <code>close</code>. It is shown in the demo above.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>The actual game logic is nothing more than a simple state machine contained inside <a href="https://github.com/metanet/match-symbols-game/blob/master/src/game.py" target="_blank"><code>src/game.py</code></a>. <code>Game</code> class is initialized with a string of unique symbols and 2 players. It duplicates and shuffles the given symbols, and puts them on a list. So each symbol is present in 2 random indices in the list.</p>

<p><code>Game</code> class knows nothing about handling of player inputs and visualization of the game deck. This part is realized by <code>GameController</code>, which is available in <a href="https://github.com/metanet/match-symbols-game/blob/master/src/game_controller.py" target="_blank"><code>src/game_controller.py</code></a>. This class represents the game deck as a 2-dimensional array. Rows are labelled from 1 to 9 and columns are labeled from A to Z. Player inputs are received as strings of length = 2 where the first character is the row label and the second character is the column label. For instance, in the demo above, the game is shown with a 4 x 6 matrix so valid inputs are between <code>1A</code> and <code>4F</code>. <code>GameController</code> converts player inputs to indices which are meaningful for <code>Game</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/metanet/match-symbols-game/blob/master/game_server.py" target="_blank"><code>src/game_server.py</code></a> uses the <a href="https://github.com/dabeaz/curio" target="_blank+">curio</a> library for running coroutines.
The game server starts a coroutine  for each connected client with the <code>_client_handler()</code> function. This function is quite simple. It first awaits on <code>_get_player_name()</code> until the user provides her name. Then, it creates a second coroutine via <code>_join_lobby()</code> and awaits on it. This coroutine returns only when the client is disconnected, so <code>_client_handler()</code> also returns afterwards.</p>

<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/metanet/6f14753f65dae29410c1a697e7221834.js"></script>


<p><code>_Player</code> is a simple class for encapsulating a client&rsquo;s stream and input/output queues. It contains a few async methods to read from and write to client streams. You can check <a href="https://github.com/metanet/match-symbols-game/blob/master/game_server.py" target="_blank"><code>src/game_server.py</code></a> for its code.</p>

<p><code>_join_lobby()</code> is the most complex function in the <a href="https://github.com/metanet/match-symbols-game/blob/master/game_server.py" target="_blank"><code>src/game_server.py</code></a> source file. It uses <code>_Randezvous</code> objects to match connected players in FIFO order. <code>curio.TaskGroup</code> is used for grouping coroutines together and managing their execution. So <code>_Randezvous</code> uses <code>curio.TaskGroup</code> to run coroutines for the game logic and communication with players.  <code>_play_game()</code> coroutine implements the game logic and the player I/O is handled via the coroutines spawned by <code>_start_player_io()</code>.  These coroutines pass messages to each other via <code>curio.Queue</code> objects. When <code>_join_lobby()</code> runs for the first player, it starts the I/O coroutines for that player along with the <code>_play_game()</code> coroutine, then joins to the task group of the current <code>_Randezvous</code> object. In this point, it practically waits until another player joins to the server. <code>_join_lobby()</code> coroutine also runs for the second player and starts the game by notifying the <code>_play_game()</code> coroutine. The current <code>_Randezvous</code> becomes full after the second client connects, hence the second player initializes a new <code>_Randezvous</code> object for new clients which will connect to the server.</p>

<script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/metanet/c24fd821c8e2be05773647add2bd2f7c.js"></script>


<p>One of the most tricky parts of working with coroutines is graceful handling of termination paths. <code>_Randezvous</code> class creates <code>curio.TaskGroup</code> objects in a way that <code>await</code> calls inside a <code>_join_lobby()</code> coroutine return when any coroutine spawned by <code>curio.TaskGroup</code> returns, i.e., either the <code>_play_game()</code> coroutine returns on game over, or a <code>_player_inbound()</code> coroutine returns on player disconnection. When the execution comes back to the  <code>_join_lobby()</code> coroutine, if both players are still active, it starts a new game. Otherwise, it joins the active player to the current randezvous state.</p>

<p>I developed <code>_join_lobby()</code> with manual testing. I have plans to cover it with unit tests, but hey, contributions are welcome!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-next">What is next?</h2>

<p>I am mostly done with the development of this game for now. I might do some minor updates to make it more Pythonic as I learn more about Python.  I just published it on <a href="https://github.com/metanet/match-symbols-game" blank="_target">Github</a> with the MIT license in case other Python developers may find it interesting or useful. So, have fun!</p>

<p>Till next time&hellip;</p>
